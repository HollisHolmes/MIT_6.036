# MIT_6.036 | Introduction to Machine Learning

## Description and Approach

This course introduces principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning from the point of view of modeling and prediction. It includes formulation of learning problems and concepts of representation, over-fitting, and generalization. These concepts are exercised in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, with applications to images and to temporal sequences.

This course was completed through MIT's open learning library[1]. The class had weekly lectures, readings, exercises, labs and homeowrks. All assignments are auto graded through MIT's server.
